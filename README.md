📘 Oracle HR Schema – Database Overview

This repository contains a detailed explanation of the Oracle HR (Human Resources) Schema, one of the most commonly used sample schemas for learning SQL, practicing queries, and understanding relational database design.

The HR Schema represents a fictional company’s employees, departments, jobs, and geographical information.
